# fractal-py

Random nebulabrot fractal nonsense written in python/cython/numpy

```bash
pip install numpy==1.19.3
pip install pypng
pip install cython

python main.py
```

You'll need a working C compiler for Cython to work, e.g. gcc
On Windows you can use the official python build, but it's probably easier to use WSL

No CLI yet, all config is still in code as I've constantly been tweaking it
