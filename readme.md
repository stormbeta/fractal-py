# fractal-py

Random nebulabrot fractal nonsense written in python/cython/numpy

```bash
pip install numpy==1.19.3
pip install pypng
pip install cython

python main.py
```

You'll need a working C compiler for Cython to work, e.g. gcc

No CLI yet, all config is still in code as I've constantly been tweaking it.
