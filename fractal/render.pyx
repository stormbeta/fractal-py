# TODO: user interface
"""
At some point this really needs a GUI for more active exploration of various parameters, especially coloring
Even automated CLI isn't enough for something like color that can displayed in real time along continuous axes
"""

# TODO: CUDA / CPU?
"""
It's unclear if GPU compute could even help much here, except maybe in specific scenarios like combined inner/outer
rendering. We'd need to batch operations across multiple traces at once, but with no way to easily intervene for points that escape or not
"""

# TODO: Native inner loop
"""
Python is quite convenient overall, but the traces still feel awfully slow compared to what I expected.
I really don't want to write everything in C/C++, but perhaps we can use something like Cython to rewrite just the inner loop?
Worst-case, extract just the foundational logic and ability to write into a data file as it's own code + config file....
Though right now, that still makes up the bulk of the program
